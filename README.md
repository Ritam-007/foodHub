# FoodHub — UI/UX Case Study 🍔📱

## Overview
FoodHub is a mobile food ordering application designed to provide users with a smooth, intuitive, and visually engaging experience while browsing restaurants and ordering meals online.

This project focuses on solving usability and navigation problems commonly found in food delivery apps, especially for first-time users.

## My Design Process

### 1. Research
I studied popular food apps like:
- Swiggy
- Zomato
- Uber Eats

I analyzed:
- navigation patterns
- cart flow
- payment process
- onboarding experience

### 2. Wireframing
Low-fidelity wireframes were created to focus on structure instead of visuals.

Key focus:
- Simple home page
- Quick restaurant access
- Easy cart visibility
- Minimal checkout steps

### 3. UI Design
I designed a clean and modern interface using:

- clear typography
- consistent spacing
- primary accent color
- high contrast buttons

I followed **mobile usability principles** and thumb-friendly interactions.

### 4. Prototype
An interactive prototype was built in Figma to simulate a real application experience.
